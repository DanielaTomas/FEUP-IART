# 5 - The Approach

For heuristics we choose implemented 2 different ones namely:

- Manhattan distance: For this heuristic, we sum the manhattan distances of all blocks of the same color

- Color clusters: For this heuristic we calculate the minimum distance between any 2 pieces of differing colors.

# 6 - Algorithms

We implemented the following algorithms

### Uninformed

- BFS
- DFS
- Uniform cost
- Iterative deepening

### Informed

- Greedy
